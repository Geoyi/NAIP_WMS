NAIP_WMS
========

These files were created from the data accesible here: http://gis.apfo.usda.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAIP

These are WMS services for the current NAIP (National Agriculture Inventory Program). These files span the years from 2011 to 2013. They are flown Leaf on usually from late spring to late summer. 

As more years become available I will be updating these files. 


Usage
========
These files were create to be loaded into QGIS. So far I have only tested QGIS 2.2 but I do suspect they will work in 2.0 and the upcoming 2.4. 


1. Open QGIS 2.x 
2. Open the WMS/WTS Menu on the manage layers toolbar. 
3. Click Load and select the XML you wish to load. 
4. Select the connection to import 
5. Connect and display the data. 

Warning
========
* The assumption is you will have the internet for these files to work. Granted I don't always have the internet so you might need to download the individual files by US County from http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov/
* In the case of Government Shutdown these links will not work (which is so unbelievably stupid I hate even typing that). 
* There is a chance I don't have some of the links wrokign properly - if so contact me (or correct and I'll merge your changes back in). 


I just want to tell you both Good Luck. We're all counting on you!
