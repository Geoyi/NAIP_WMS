NAIP_WMS
========

These files were created from the data accesible here: http://gis.apfo.usda.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAIP

These are WMS services for the current NAIP (National Agriculture Inventory Program). These files span the years from 2011 to 2013. They are flown Leaf on usually from late spring to late summer. 

As more years become available I will be updating these files. 


Usage
========
These files were create to be loaded into QGIS. So far I have only tested QGIS 2.2 but I do suspect they will work in 2.0 and the upcoming 2.4.
